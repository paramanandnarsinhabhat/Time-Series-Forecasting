# Time Series Forecasting Using Naive Approach

This repository contains the implementation of a time series forecasting model using the naive approach. The project demonstrates basic time series analysis and forecasting techniques on a dataset containing temporal data.

## Overview

The naive approach is one of the simplest methods for forecasting time series data. It assumes that the most recent observation is the best reflection of the future. In this project, we use this approach to make predictions and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset is divided into training and validation sets and contains the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of observation.
- `count`: The target variable, representing the quantity to be forecasted.

## Requirements

To run the scripts, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
- `scikit-learn`: For calculating the root mean square error (RMSE).

## File Descriptions

- `time_series_naive.py`: This script contains the Python code for time series forecasting using the naive approach.
- `Time_series_Naive Approach`: This notebook contains the Python code for time series forecasting using naive  approach
## Implementation Details

1. Data is read from CSV files into pandas DataFrames.
2. The `Date` column is converted to datetime format and set as the index for both training and validation datasets.
3. The training and validation data are visualized to understand the trend and seasonality.
4. The naive model is implemented by taking the last observation from the training data and using it as the forecast for the entire validation period.
5. The model's performance is evaluated using the RMSE metric.

## Visualization

The script generates the following plots:
1. A comparison of training and validation data.
2. The naive forecast alongside the actual observations.

## Results

The RMSE value for the Naive Approach is calculated to quantify the model's accuracy.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
python time_series_naive.py
```

Ensure that the required data files are present in the specified directory.
